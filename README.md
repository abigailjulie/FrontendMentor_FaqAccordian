## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- ADA

### What I learned

I am gaining more experience using event listeners and algorithms. The main emphasis on this project was accessibility and I implemented most of the concepts.

### Continued development

I will continue to learn about selecting multiple elements with one class and then using methods to create algorithms.
